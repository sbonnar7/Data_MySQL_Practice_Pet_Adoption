# Star Wars Uber

## Introduction

'Star Wars Uber' is my submission for Assignment 2 'Python' for the CFG Degree Program. This project is a console app that interacts with the [Star Wars Swapi API](https://swapi.dev/api/starships/) and asks users to input their preference for their next trip across the galaxy.

## Features

This program guides users through the process of selecting a spaceship and pilot for their journey across the galaxy. This consists of a series of interactions through the Python console:

1. Asking the user to select their preferred speed through a specified range (Slow, Medium, Fast, Super Fast)
2. A list of spaceships with max speed within this range are then presented to the user and they are asked their preference
3. A list of pilots known to fly this spaceship are then presented to the user and they are asked their preference
4. The user is then told their selection, and told the price of this ship - calculated as a fraction of the total price of the spaceship.
5. A receipt is then printed as a '.txt' file for the users convenience.

**Please note, no guarantees are made for the aliegence of the pilots**
